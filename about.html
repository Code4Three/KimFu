                    <p>About me... I was born in Adelaide in 1977 into a middle class family, the third child of... wait... you don't care about that do you? You just want to know 
                        if I can help you train don't you? Ok then...</p>
                    <p>I'm an average person just like you and I've had, and still have, my own strugles with fitness, health, diet, wellbeing and life in general. But I'm committed. 
                    Committed to being the best me I can be, mentally, physically, emotionally, inside and outside. I don't always succeed but I garautee I will give it my all 
                    to reach my goals.</p>
                    <p>And I'll give my all to help you reach yours too. I'd like to be able to tell you it'll be easy. I'd like to make it easy. But the truth is it's not easy, and 
                        I can't make it easy. There'll be blood, sweat, tears, probably a lot of swearing. But I can guarantee it will be worth it and I garauntee we'll have some fun 
                        along the way too.
                    </p>
                    <p>I'm starting this all off with one class a week. If everything goes well I'll expand from there based on your feedback. So please tell your friends and 
                        leave some feedback on the classes, location, days times, whatever. I'm keen to adapt to what you all want and try to fit around what you need.  
                    </p>
                    <p>So that's enough about that... Head over to the <a href="#classes">classes</a> section, sign up, and lets get started!!</p>
